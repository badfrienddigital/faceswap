Built a version of Faceswap locally.
All based on code/tutorial by @matthewearl.
Original README is below:

This is the code behind the [Switching Eds blog post](http://matthewearl.github.io/2015/07/28/switching-eds-with-python/).

See the link for an explanation of the code.

To run the script you'll need to install dlib (http://dlib.net) including its
Python bindings, and OpenCV. You'll also need to obtain the trained model [from
sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dclib/files/dlib/v18.10/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2).

Unzip with `bunzip2` and change `PREDICTOR_PATH` to refer to this file. The
script is run like so:

    ./faceswap.py <head image> <face image>

If successful, a file `output.jpg` will be produced with the facial features
from `<head image>` replaced with the facial features from `<face image>`.
